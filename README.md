# Bash-To-Python

Converting *NIX utilities to Python for fun and (probably not) profit.

I thought it would be a good exercise to go through and create python versions
of some common Bash utilities, so, here we go!

## Completed

* cat
* tail
    * Not quite feature complete, but it's probably as far as I'm going to
        go with it.
